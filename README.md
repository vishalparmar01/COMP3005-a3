How to run: 

    1) Add your pgAdmin password on line 10 of the code. Replace "your_password" with your own password.
    2) Run the python file as there is the main function that shows all the CRUD operations. 
    3) Open your pgAdmin and check for Student Database. 
    4) Go to query tool and type SELECT * FROM students; to see the final table after all CRUD operations.
